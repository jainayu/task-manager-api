## Task Manager API

I learnt how to connect to a MongoDB database from your Node.js application. This allows my application to store data in a secure and reliable fashion. The task application will use MongoDB to store user accounts as well as tasks.

Then I be created a REST API using Express. I learnt what exactly a REST API is and how it can be used as the back-end for a web or mobile application. I also covered data validation, application architecture, async/await, and more.

*Mongoose makes it easy to model and manage your application data. This includes data sanitization, data validation, and more. Mongoose will serve as a replacement for the native driver, providing you with a more object-oriented interface.*
