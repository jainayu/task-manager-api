## Task Manager API

I learnt how to connect to a MongoDB database from your Node.js application. This allows my application to store data in a secure and reliable fashion. The task application will use MongoDB to store user accounts as well as tasks.

Then, I be created a REST API using Express. I learnt what exactly a REST API is and how it can be used as the back-end for a web or mobile application. I also covered data validation, application architecture, async/await, and more.

*Mongoose makes it easy to model and manage your application data. This includes data sanitization, data validation, and more. Mongoose will serve as a replacement for the native driver, providing you with a more object-oriented interface.*

Then, I set up authentication for the task manager app. This required users to log in before they’ll be able to manage their tasks. I also covered password security, Express middleware, and more.

Then, I explored advanced techniques for fetching data. This includes sorting, filtering, and pagination. All three of these gave clients more control over what data they get back. This keeps applications fast, as they don’t need to fetch unnecessary data.

Moving forward, I learnt how to configure Node.js to support file uploads. This allows users to upload documents, profile pictures, and any other file type app might need to support. I also saw what it takes to store the uploaded files in MongoDB.

Then, I added email sending to my Node.js application! This allows me to communicate with users as they use the app. This could be useful for welcome emails, notifications, and more!
